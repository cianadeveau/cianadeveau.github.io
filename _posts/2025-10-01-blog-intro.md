Welcome to my blog! I envision this as my dumping ground for all fun side projects I want to share. You can expect to see mostly mechanistic interpretability projects as I expand my research on the computational principles underlying intelligent behavior in the brain to artificial systems. While interpretability methods in these fields are conceptually quite similar, in practice they are not! I'm in the process of learning these methods and therefore these first couple posts are really my first attempts at conducting this research. So please, keep that in mind while reading and as always in research, keep a critical eye. I'm excited to see where this goes!

I hope you enjoy the content and absolutely feel free to reach out to me if you want to chat about it!
