Hello! I am a PhD candidate at the National Institutes of Health and Brown University studying neural computation underlying perception and learning. I'm fascinated by how complex networks - both biological and artificial - represent and process information. 

Prior to my PhD, I received my Bachelor's degree from the University of Virginia in Biology and French, accompanied by research in treatments for glioblastoma. My post-bac at the NIH is wehre I explored functional properties of zebrafish retina under disease conditions while also teaching myself python and familiarizing myself with artificial intelligence. I've been interested in the similarities between neural computation in the brain and in artificial networks ever since. While my datasets changed from cancer to retinal circuits to recurrent circuits, my goal has stayed the same: try to elucidate the mechanisms underlying functional dynamics. 

Check out my Google Scholar for up to date publications and my GitHub for various side projects.
